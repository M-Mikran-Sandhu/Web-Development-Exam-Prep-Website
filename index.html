                        <h3>Virtual DOM - How React Works</h3>
                        <p>React keeps a copy of your webpage in memory called Virtual DOM. When something changes, it updates this copy first, then updates only the parts that changed on the real webpage. This is very fast!</p>

                        <div class="important-note">
                            <strong>🔑 Key Concept:</strong> Virtual DOM → Compare → Update Real DOM → Browser Shows Update
                        </div>

                        <h3>Application Rendering Sequence</h3>
                        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> React reads your code<br>
                        <strong>Step 2:</strong> Creates Virtual DOM (copy of webpage)<br>
                        <strong>Step 3:</strong> Compares with real DOM<br>
                        <strong>Step 4:</strong> Updates only what changed<br>
                        <strong>Step 5:</strong> Browser shows the update</p>

                        <h3>Setting up React with Vite</h3>
                        <p>Vite is a fast tool to create React projects. Much faster than Create React App!</p>

                        <h3>🎯 React Fundamentals</h3>
                        <p><strong>Components:</strong> Reusable UI pieces<br>
                        <strong>Props:</strong> Pass data to components (read-only)<br>
                        <strong>State:</strong> Data that can change<br>
                        <strong>Virtual DOM:</strong> How React updates efficiently<br>
                        <strong>JSX:</strong> HTML-like syntax in JavaScript</p>

                        <h3>🎯 Common Exam Questions</h3>
                        <p><strong>Q: What's the difference between props and state?</strong><br>
                        A: Props are read-only data from parent to child. State is data that can change inside a component.</p>

                        <p><strong>Q: When do you use useEffect?</strong><br>
                        A: Use useEffect to fetch data, set up timers, or run code after the component renders.</p>

                        <p><strong>Q: How do you handle forms in React?</strong><br>
                        A: Use useState to track input values. This creates a "controlled component".</p>

                        <p><strong>Q: What are keys in lists?</strong><br>
                        A: Keys help React identify which items changed. Always use unique IDs, never use array index.</p>

                        <p><strong>Q: How do you fetch data from an API?</strong><br>
                        A: Use fetch() inside useEffect. Convert response to JSON and update state.</p>
